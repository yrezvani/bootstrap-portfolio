# Bootstrap Portfolio
This is a webpage showcasing my portfolio of web apps using Bootstrap. You can find links to live deployments as well as my GitHub dashboard. I have taken a mobile-first, responsive design approach which was made easy by Bootstrap.
I have designed this portfolio in order to give potential employers an idea of the kinds of projects I have worked on so far.
